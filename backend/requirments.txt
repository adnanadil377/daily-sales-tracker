# --- Core FastAPI & Server ---
fastapi
uvicorn[standard] # ASGI server, [standard] includes httptools and websockets

# --- Authentication & Security ---
python-jose[cryptography]   # For JWT creation and decoding (includes cryptography backend)
passlib[bcrypt]             # For password hashing (bcrypt is a strong algorithm)
python-multipart

# --- Database ORM & Migrations ---
sqlalchemy                # The ORM toolkit
# Choose your database driver below:
psycopg2-binary           # For PostgreSQL (most common with FastAPI & SQLAlchemy)
# mysqlclient             # For MySQL/MariaDB (uncomment if you use this)
# python-sqlite3          # For SQLite (often built-in with Python, but good to be explicit if needed)
# asyncpg                 # For asynchronous PostgreSQL (if you plan to use async DB operations)
alembic                   # For database schema migrations

# --- Data Validation & Settings Management ---
pydantic                  # FastAPI dependency, used for data validation and models
pydantic-settings         # For loading settings from .env files and environment variables
python-dotenv             # To load .env files (often used by pydantic-settings)
email-validator           # If you use Pydantic's EmailStr and want validation

# --- (Optional) Development & Linting/Formatting ---
# flake8                  # For linting
# black                   # For code formatting
# isort                   # For sorting imports
# pytest                  # For running tests
# pytest-cov              # For test coverage
# httpx                   # For making async HTTP requests (useful for testing API endpoints)
